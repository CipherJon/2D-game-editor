### Summary of Changes:
1. **Added Flake8 Configuration**: Created a `.flake8` file to configure linting and static analysis for the project.
2. **Set Line Length**: Set the maximum line length to 88 characters.
3. **Ignored Specific Errors**: Ignored the `E203` error to avoid conflicts with Black's formatting.
4. **Excluded Directories**: Excluded directories like `venv/`, `.git/`, `__pycache__/`, `build/`, and `dist/` from linting.

These changes ensure that the project adheres to consistent code quality standards and best practices.
